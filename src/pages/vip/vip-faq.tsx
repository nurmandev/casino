                            Showcasing our appreciation for players, we reward them with a Level Up bonus upon reaching
                            the next level. Once players reach Level 38 and higher, we have boosted the level-up bonus
                            to be slightly higher than the regular level-up bonus available at lower levels.

                            The ‘Weekly Cashback’ is an exclusive perk on our platform designed for VIP 22+ players. As
                            the name suggests, this bonus is issued once a week. It is an automatic bonus paid out every
                            Friday to players at VIP level 22 and above. The size of the bonus depends on how much a
                            player has wagered during the past week with a minimum wager requirement of $1000 between
                            the period Friday-Thursday. The calculation for the weekly cashback remains the same, and
                            the only difference is that it may not align with your Recharge renewals.
